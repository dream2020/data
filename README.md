Within the European research project [DREAM: Development of Robot-Enhanced therapy for children with AutisM spectrum disorders](http://www.dream2020.eu), a large evaluation of _Robot Assisted Therapy (RAT)_ has been conducted, compared to traditional _Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA)_. 76 children diagnosed with _Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)_ participated, going through a total of almost 4000 therapy sessions and more than 360 hours of therapy. Each session was recorded with three RGB cameras and two RGBD (Kinect) cameras, providing detailed information of children's behavior during therapy.
